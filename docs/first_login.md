When an account is setup for you, you will be sent a temporary password. Use your full name as your username with the first letter in each name as a capital and no space in the middle. For example BenBridges or ColinDerby.

Use your temporary password this first time. If any of your details are incorrect, you will be notified. You may toggle the `Remember Username` switch to make the browser remember and autofill your Username.

Upon a successful login, you will be presented with the following screen. This allows you to set your own personal password. This password must contain at least one capital letter, two numbers and be eight characters long. If your password does not meet these criteria, you will not be able to submit the form.

If at any point you forget your password, please contact Lisa Wilford or Ben Bridges. A new temporary password will then be sent to you and you will have to proceed with the above steps again.
